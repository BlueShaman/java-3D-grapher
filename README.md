# 3D Grapher
3D Grapher is a software for plotting functions of two variables. It is a easy-to-use, GPU accelerated, tool for
making various surface plots. GPU acceleration is implemented using Java Bindings for OpenGL - JOGL.

## Features
* GPU accelerated rendering (OpenGL)
* Integrated function parser (using exp4j library)
* Matlab-like coloured surface plots
* Wireframe plots
* Controllable camera
* UI widgets

## Requirements
* JDK 8 
* OpenGL 2+

## Dependencies
* JOGL 2.3.2+
* exp4j
